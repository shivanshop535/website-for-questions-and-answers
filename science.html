                <h3>4. Give reasons:</h3>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question 1: Food becomes acidic in the stomach.</h4>
                    <p>Answer: The gastric glands of the stomach secrete gastric juice. Food that has entered the stomach is churned. Three components of gastric juice namely hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and mucus are mixed with food here and the food becomes acidic.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question 2: Cardiac muscles are said to be involuntary muscles.</h4>
                    <p>Answer: Cardiac muscles are found in the heart. These muscles bring about the contraction and relaxation (beating) of the heart. Their movement is involuntary. Cardiac muscles cause our heart to relax and contract continuously at a rate of about 70 times per minute. They do not depend upon our will. Beating is carried out in their own fixed manner. So cardiac muscles are said to be involuntary muscles.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question 3: Intoxicating substances should not be consumed.</h4>
                    <p>Answer: Physical health is important for our organ system to function properly. But harmful habits like smoking, chewing of tobacco, drinking alcohol affect our health adversely. If we consume any tobacco products, the mouth, pharynx, alimentary canal, and other organs of the digestive system cannot function properly. It causes problems like vomiting, nausea, and headache. Tobacco particles stick to teeth, gums, and skin of the mouth cavity and slowly cause injury to those parts resulting in their dysfunction. This causes swelling of the gums and pain when moving the jaws. The pharynx and intestine become inflamed it progress into cancer leading to death.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question 4: Your muscles should be strong and efficient.</h4>
                    <p>Answer: Muscles are bundles of fibres that can contract and relax as required. The action of muscles is necessary for all kinds of movements from the small movements of eyelid to those that demand great strength when chopping wood with an axe. We use muscles for various movements like talking laughing, walking, jumping, throwing etc. Therefore our muscles should be strong and efficient to do our day today work well and smooth functioning of life processes.</p>

                <h3>5. Answer the following:</h3>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question a: How many types of muscles are there? Which are those types?</h4>
                    <p>Answer: Muscles are bundles of fibres that can contract and relax as required. There are three types of muscles. Skeletal muscles. Heart or cardiac muscles. Smooth muscles.</p>
                    <p>1. Skeletal muscles: (a) Skeletal muscles work with bones, the two ends of each of these muscles are attached to two different bones. (b) They are responsible for holding the bones of the skeleton together and giving shape to our body, (c) Skeletal muscles permits movement of t the body and maintain the posture of the body. (d) Skeletal muscle is voluntary e.g. muscles in our arms and legs are voluntary muscles, their action depends upon our will. That’s why they are called voluntary muscles.</p>
                    <p>2. Heart or cardiac muscles: (a) Heart or cardiac muscles bring about the contraction and relaxation (beating) of the heart. (b) Their movement is involuntary, (c) Cardiac muscles cause our heart to relax and contract continuously at a rate of about 70 times per minute, (d) Cardiac muscle is found in heart.</p>
                    <p>3. Smooth muscles: (a) These muscles are present in the internal organs other than the heart, e.g. muscles of the stomach, intestine, blood vessels, uterus etc. (b)Their movements are involuntary and slow, (c) They are not according to our will. (d) Various vital functions of our body such as digestion, respiration and movement of food material of which we remain quite unaware, are carried out by these special muscles.</p>
