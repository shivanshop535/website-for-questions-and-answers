                <h3>4. Give reasons:</h3>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question 1: Food becomes acidic in the stomach.</h4>
                    <p>Answer: The gastric glands of the stomach secrete gastric juice. Food that has entered the stomach is churned. Three components of gastric juice namely hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and mucus are mixed with food here and the food becomes acidic.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question 2: Cardiac muscles are said to be involuntary muscles.</h4>
                    <p>Answer: Cardiac muscles are found in the heart. These muscles bring about the contraction and relaxation (beating) of the heart. Their movement is involuntary. Cardiac muscles cause our heart to relax and contract continuously at a rate of about 70 times per minute. They do not depend upon our will. Beating is carried out in their own fixed manner. So cardiac muscles are said to be involuntary muscles.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question 3: Intoxicating substances should not be consumed.</h4>
                    <p>Answer: Physical health is important for our organ system to function properly. But harmful habits like smoking, chewing of tobacco, drinking alcohol affect our health adversely. If we consume any tobacco products, the mouth, pharynx, alimentary canal, and other organs of the digestive system cannot function properly. It causes problems like vomiting, nausea, and headache. Tobacco particles stick to teeth, gums, and skin of the mouth cavity and slowly cause injury to those parts resulting in their dysfunction. This causes swelling of the gums and pain when moving the jaws. The pharynx and intestine become inflamed it progress into cancer leading to death.</p>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h4>Question 4: Your muscles should be strong and efficient.</h4>
                    <p>Answer: Muscles are bundles of fibres that can contract and relax as required. The action of muscles is necessary for all kinds of movements from the small movements of eyelid to those that demand great strength when chopping wood with an axe. We use muscles for various movements like talking laughing, walking, jumping, throwing etc. Therefore our muscles should be strong and efficient to do our day today work well and smooth functioning of life processes.</p>

                 <p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are three types of muscles:</p>
               <ul>
              <li><strong>Skeletal Muscles:</strong> These muscles are attached to bones, allow movement, and are voluntary. They help in posture and shape of the body.</li>
              <li><strong>Cardiac Muscles:</strong> Found in the heart, they contract and relax involuntarily to maintain heartbeat.</li>
              <li><strong>Smooth Muscles:</strong> Located in internal organs (e.g., stomach and intestines), they perform involuntary movements for bodily functions like digestion.</li>
             </ul>

               <h4>Question b.</h4>
               <p><strong>What causes the problem of acidity? What is its effect on the body?</strong></p>
               <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Acidity can be caused by stress, irregular meals, spicy food, alcohol, or missing meals. It may lead to stomach discomfort, chest burning, weight gain, and cardiovascular risks.</p>
             </ul>
              
                <h4>Question c.</h4>
               <p><strong>Name the different types of teeth. What is the function of each type?</strong></p>
               <p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are four types of teeth:</p>
             
                 <ul>
              <li><strong>Incisors:</strong> Front teeth for cutting food.</li>
              <li><strong>Canines:</strong> Sharp teeth for tearing food.</li>
              <li><strong>Pre-molars:</strong> Grind food for easier swallowing.</li>
              <li><strong>Molars:</strong> Broad, flat teeth for crushing food. They require special care due to their position.</li>
