        <div class="qa">
            <h4>Question e: The process of preparing their own food in presence of sunlight and chloroplast by plants cells is known as ……….. .</h4>
            <p>Answer: photosynthesis.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. What is the difference between us?</h3>
        <div class="qa">
            <h4>Question a: Plant cell and animal cell.</h4>
            <p>Answer:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plant cell has cell wall. Animal cell does not.</li>
                    <li>Plant cell has definite shape due to the presence of cell wall. Animal cells lack a definite shape.</li>
                    <li>Plant cell has one large vacuole. Animal cells have multiple smaller vacuoles.</li>
                    <li>Plant cell contains chloroplasts for photosynthesis, animal cells do not.</li>
                    <li>Plastids are present in plant cells but absent in animal cells.</li>
                    <li>Centrosomes are absent in plant cells but present in animal cells.</li>
                    <li>Lysosomes are absent in plant cells but present in animal cells.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <h4>Question b: Prokaryotic cell and Eukaryotic cell</h4>
            <p>Answer:
                <ul>
                    <li>Prokaryotic cells lack a well-defined nucleus. Eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus.</li>
                    <li>Ribosomes in prokaryotic cells are small, while in eukaryotic cells, they are large.</li>
                    <li>Prokaryotic cells have a single length of DNA, while eukaryotic cells have several lengths of genetic material.</li>
                    <li>Prokaryotic cells lack other organelles, whereas eukaryotic cells have organelles like mitochondria, chloroplasts, etc.</li>
                    <li>Examples of prokaryotic cells include bacteria and blue-green algae, while eukaryotic cells include Euglena, Amoeba, and all plant and animal cells.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>4. Sketch and describe in your own words, the plant cell and animal cell:</h3>
        <div class="qa">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>Plant cells have a definite shape due to the presence of a cell wall. They contain a large central vacuole and chloroplasts. Animal cells do not have a cell wall, they have multiple smaller vacuoles and lack chloroplasts.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5. Explain the uses and the harmful effects of micro-organisms:</h3>
        <div class="qa">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Micro-organisms are used in fermentation, nitrogen fixation, waste decomposition, and vaccine production.</p>
            <p><strong>Harmful Effects:</strong> Some microbes cause diseases like malaria, typhoid, and food poisoning.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>6. Give reasons:</h3>
        <div class="qa">
            <h4>Question a: Diseases spread on a large scale during periods of heavy rainfall and floods.</h4>
            <p>Answer: Floods contaminate water and create breeding grounds for mosquitoes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <h4>Question b: There is a possibility of food poisoning if we eat stale food.</h4>
            <p>Answer: Microbes grow on stale food, releasing toxins that cause illness.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>7. When will you use a simple microscope and when a compound microscope?</h3>
        <div class="qa">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>I will use a simple microscope to magnify the objects and to see the growth of a fungi or mucor on a piece of moist bread.<p>
            <p>I will use a compound microscope in Research Laboratory and high school science lab to observe micro-organisms which we are not able to see with our naked eye.</p>
